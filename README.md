# CollegeNarad

## Motive
1. Enlist all academic resources for _B.Tech Computer Science Engineering_ categorically in an easy-to-find way.

2. Help fellow students in-case they need any of these.

## Challenges
* Copyright issues ( and Suggested SOLUTIONS )

    * Remove materials in case of copyright claim.
    * Will provide public links to resources(ebooks/videos/etc) instead of directly providing them for download.
    * For Resouces guaranteed of no copyright like notes taken in classes
        * upload them to google-drive. (preferably in .pdf format)
        * set visibility public but keep editing rights only to the organization.
        * provide public google drive link to users.


* Tracking duplicate resources

    * deciding which copy to publish .(based on quality)
    * requires manual effort.
